# Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) Project with Ktor

## üîπ What is Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)?
Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) is a powerful feature of Kotlin that allows developers to write shared code across multiple platforms, including **Android**, **iOS**, **Desktop**, and **Web**. It enables code reusability while allowing platform-specific implementations where necessary.

### ‚úÖ Key Benefits of KMP:
- **Code Reusability**: Write business logic once and use it across different platforms.
- **Platform-Specific Code**: Add platform-specific implementations when needed.
- **Interoperability**: Works seamlessly with existing platform code (Java, Swift, etc.).
- **Easy Integration**: Can be used in existing projects without major architectural changes.

## üîπ Project Overview
This project is a **Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) application** that fetches and displays a list using **Ktor** for network requests. The project supports **Android** and **iOS** platforms, ensuring shared business logic while utilizing platform-specific UI components.

### üìå Features
- Uses **Ktor** for making network requests.
- Fetches a list of items from an API.
- Supports **Android** and **iOS** platforms.
- Uses **Jetpack Compose** for Android UI.
- Uses **SwiftUI** for iOS UI.

## üåç API Integration
The project integrates with an API to fetch a list of items. The API response is processed and mapped into a data model for use in the UI.
